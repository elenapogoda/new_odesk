My new try to work with Git.

Sublime settings:
    // The number of spaces a tab is considered equal to
    "tab_size": 2,

    // Set to true to insert spaces when tab is pressed
    "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,

    // Trims white space added by auto_indent when moving the caret off the
    // line.
    "trim_automatic_white_space": true,

    // Set to "none" to turn off drawing white space, "selection" to draw only the
    // white space within the selection, and "all" to draw all white space
    "draw_white_space": "all",

Sublime plugins:
